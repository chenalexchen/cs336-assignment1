### Training a BPE Tokenizer

Use the `train_bpe` binary to train a tokenizer on your text data:

```bash
./target/release/train_bpe <input_file> <vocab_size> <output_dir> [special_tokens...]
```

#### Arguments

- `input_file`: Path to the input text file for training
- `vocab_size`: Target vocabulary size (e.g., 32000, 50000)
- `output_dir`: Directory to save the trained tokenizer files
- `special_tokens`: Optional special tokens (default: `<|endoftext|>`)

#### Examples

Train on OpenWebText with vocabulary size 32,000:
```bash
./target/release/train_bpe ../data/owt_train.txt 32000 ../tokenizer_output/owt_32k
```

Train with custom special tokens:
```bash
./target/release/train_bpe ../data/owt_train.txt 50000 ../tokenizer_output/owt_50k "<|endoftext|>" "<|pad|>" "<|unk|>"
```

Train on TinyStories dataset:
```bash
./target/release/train_bpe ../data/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt 8000 ../tokenizer_output/tinystories_8k
```

### Output Files

The training process creates three files in the output directory:

1. **`vocab.json`**: Token-to-ID mapping in JSON format
2. **`merges.txt`**: BPE merge rules in standard format
3. **`training_stats.txt`**: Training configuration and statistics

### üéØ Key Optimization Techniques

#### 1. **Inverted Pair Index (O(1) Affected Word Lookup)**
- **Algorithm**: Maps each token pair to words containing it
- **Impact**: Eliminates O(n) linear word scanning
- **Speedup**: 29-97% depending on sparsity
- **Trade-off**: 9s upfront indexing cost, breaks even at ~19 merges

#### 2. **Affected Word Filtering** 
- **Algorithm**: Only processes words containing the target pair
- **Impact**: Reduces work from 100% to 0.1-9.6% of words per iteration
- **Speedup**: 30-80% for most merges
- **Insight**: Later merges become increasingly sparse

#### 3. **Parallel Affected Word Processing**
- **Algorithm**: Rayon-based parallel processing of filtered word lists
- **Impact**: Utilizes all CPU cores for affected word subset
- **Speedup**: ~2-4x on multi-core systems
- **Optimization**: Adaptive chunk sizing based on workload

#### 4. **Memory Pool Optimization**
- **Algorithm**: Vec<i32> object pooling to avoid allocations
- **Impact**: Reduces memory allocation overhead
- **Speedup**: 5-15% improvement in merge processing
- **Details**: Pre-allocated capacity with efficient reuse

#### 5. **Fast Hash Maps & Data Structures**
- **Algorithm**: FxHashMap with optimized capacity planning
- **Impact**: Faster pair counting and lookup operations  
- **Speedup**: 10-20% improvement in data operations
- **Details**: Pre-sized with custom hashers

### üìä Performance Characteristics by Data Sparsity

The ultra-optimized version shows **adaptive performance scaling**:

| Affected Words | Performance Gain | Typical Use Case |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 0.1% | **97% faster** | Late-stage merges |
| 0.5-1.0% | **85% faster** | Mid-stage merges |
| 2-4% | **60% faster** | Early-mid merges |
| 5-10% | **20-40% faster** | Early merges |
| >10% | Similar/slower | Very early merges |

### üß™ Failed Optimization Experiments

**SIMD + Batch Processing Results:**
- **Outcome**: 30% slower than ultra-optimized version
- **Issue**: Coordination overhead exceeded parallelization benefits
- **Lesson**: Advanced optimizations don't always help; simple algorithms often win
- **Details**: Conflict detection and cache misses destroyed performance gains

### üí° Optimization Insights & Learnings

1. **Algorithmic > Implementation**: The inverted pair index provided the biggest win
2. **Sparsity Matters**: BPE naturally becomes sparser, optimizations should leverage this
3. **Measure Everything**: Detailed profiling revealed unexpected bottlenecks
4. **Simple Wins**: Basic optimizations (affected word filtering) often outperform complex ones
5. **Trade-offs**: Index building cost vs. per-merge savings - break-even analysis crucial

### üöÄ Production Performance

**Estimated performance on full 32K vocabulary training (~31,744 merges):**
- **Time savings**: ~5-6 hours compared to baseline
- **Scaling**: Performance improves as training progresses (due to sparsity)
- **Memory**: <2GB peak usage with optimized data structures
- **Throughput**: 100+ MB/s text processing with ~0.5s average per merge

## Implementation Details

### Pre-tokenization

The tokenizer uses GPT-2 style pre-tokenization with regex patterns:
- Splits on whitespace and punctuation boundaries
- Preserves contractions and common patterns
- Handles Unicode characters properly

### BPE Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Start with base vocabulary of 256 byte tokens plus special tokens
2. **Frequency Counting**: Extract word frequencies from training data
3. **Merge Learning**: Iteratively find and apply the most frequent byte pair merges
4. **Vocabulary Building**: Build final vocabulary with learned merges

### Special Token Handling

- Special tokens are added to the vocabulary but never split during pre-tokenization
- They receive fixed token IDs starting from 256
- Merge training operates on the remaining vocabulary space

## Python Integration

This Rust implementation can be compiled as a Python extension module using PyO3:

```bash
# Install in development mode
maturin develop

# Build wheel for distribution
maturin build --release
```

## Dependencies

- **regex**: Fast regex engine for pre-tokenization patterns
- **rayon**: Data parallelism for multi-core processing
- **rustc-hash**: Fast hash maps for frequency counting
- **memchr**: Optimized byte search operations
- **serde_json**: JSON serialization for vocabulary files
- **pyo3**: Python bindings (optional)
